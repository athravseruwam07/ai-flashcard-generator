photosynthesis basics\n\nphotosynthesis converts light energy into chemical energy stored in glucose. it occurs mainly in chloroplasts of plant cells. there are two major stages: the light-dependent reactions and the calvin cycle (light-independent reactions).\n\nlight-dependent reactions take place in the thylakoid membranes. chlorophyll absorbs photons, exciting electrons that move through an electron transport chain, generating atp and nadph. water is split (photolysis) to replace electrons, releasing oxygen.\n\ncalvin cycle occurs in the stroma. it fixes co2 using rubisco, forming g3p through reduction and regeneration phases. atp and nadph from the light reactions power these steps. some g3p exits to build glucose and other carbohydrates.\n\nlimitations include light intensity, co2 concentration, temperature, and water availability. different pathways (c3, c4, cam) adapt to environmental conditions.\n```
